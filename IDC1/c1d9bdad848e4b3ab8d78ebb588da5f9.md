-   **Peak Time:** 12:00 PM - 3:00 PM on the sale day

### [System Specifications]{.underline}

-   **Server Count:** 5

-   **CPU Cores per Server:** 8

-   **RAM per Server:** 32GB

-   **Network Bandwidth per Server:** 1Gbps

### [Additional Considerations]{.underline}

-   **New Product Launch:** A highly anticipated product will be
    released during the sale.

**Part 2. Network Scalability Analysis**

Recall the e-commerce website scenario we discussed earlier. Given the
expected surge in traffic, analyze the provided network topology
diagram. Identify potential bottlenecks and areas where scalability
might be a concern. Propose specific strategies to improve the
network\'s scalability and performance to ensure a seamless user
experience during the peak traffic period. Consider factors such as
increased user demand, new applications, and security threats.
